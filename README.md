# Snowblower_UI
Flutter UI for our autonomous snowblower, the Sno-Problem. Includes options for remote control and autonomous use as well as live tracking.

Note that as the only contributor, it was not necessary to use version control at the time so this is uploaded in a single commit after the fact.
